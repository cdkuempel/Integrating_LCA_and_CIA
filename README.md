# Integrating_LCA_and_CIA

This repository accompanies the publication by Kuempel et al. 2020 Integrating life cycle and impact assessments to map food's cumulative environmental footprint published in One Earth.

# Repository structure

## 1. data

Input data used within the scripts to produce modified data that is saved in the outputs folder. Data used is from Poore and Nemecek 2018 and Hilborn et al. 2018. See the main text and Supplemental materials for further information.

## 2. scripts

There are two scripts that should be executed in sequential order as follows:
 - Theoretical_example_on_farm_kg_liveweight.Rmd
        This script implements the proposed methodology with a hypothetical example using beef, salmon aquaculture, small pelagic fisheries and maize production. See the manuscript text and Supplemental Methods for a complete description.
        
 - Theoretical_example_plots.Rmd
         This script creates the figures seen in the manuscript. Figure 1 and further processing of figures was done in powerpoint and are thus not produced within the script.


## 3. outputs

The data created in the theoretical example script are saved in the outputs folder 

## 4. figures

Figures created in the Theoretical_example_plots.Rmd script are saved in the figures folder. Further processing was performed to create Figure 2 in powerpoint.
